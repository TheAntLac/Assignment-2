# Assignment-2 AND SCREENSHOTS OF WORKS DONE AND HOW IT WORKS
Assignment 2 for 303
PART 1
Had forgotten to make a menu or if it needed one. But, if it was given a menu like Part 2 then it would still be able to run.
Below is what would happen if certain commands were inputed into it.

PART 2

You're given a choice of 1 to 6, each one displaying what each number can do for you.
You start off with a fresh Stack, so there will be nothing and what you add will be
recorded into it until the exit of the program.
